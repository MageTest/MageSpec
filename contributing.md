## Pull Request Guidelines

* Please check to make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned. We also recommend checking for issues related to the issue on the tracker, as a team member may be working on the issue in a branch or fork.
* Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first
* Develop in a topic/feature branch, not master, we recommend to follow [this](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) approach if possible
* Add relevant tests to cover the change
* Lint the code by running `php -l` or using your preferred tool of choice
* Make sure the test-suite passes: (unit: `bin/phpspec run`, integration: `bin/behat`)
* Squash your commits
* Write a convincing description of your PR and why we should land it
